To correctly measure GPU info with MSI Afterburner please remember to move the included
MSIAfterburner.dll file from either 32 bit or 64 bit plugin folder (depending on your OS)
to the Plugins folder where Rainmeter is installed (don't move the dolfer, just the file)

Default is C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins\

Use GPU 01 if only have a single GPU

If more than one use appropirate ones.
