Like who the hell read readme files
*credits to abu46 for orignal skin.*

Use config.ini to configure what you need. All the config stuff should be pretty straightforward.

Colors can be changed with RGBA values
RGB - Red Green Blue (value from 0 to 255)
A - Alpha for transparency (value from 0 to 255). Optional. By default Alpha = 255

Use this format R,G,B,A
Example: 255,105,50

The circle button next to the text bar allows user to choose their own color instead of typing R, G, B, A value.

To correctly measure GPU info with MSI Afterburner please remember to move the included
MSIAfterburner.dll file from either 32 bit or 64 bit plugin folder (depending on your OS)
to the Plugins folder where Rainmeter is installed (don't move the dolfer, just the file)
Default is C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins\

Input Max Download/Upload to display it on the bar

All changes made in config.ini will have affect immedietely.
